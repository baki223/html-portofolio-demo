    <h4>Čenta is a settlement of the city of Zrenjanin in the Central Banat district, in Serbia. Chenta is a typical Banat village. The biggest specificity is the geographical position of the village, because the centers, Belgrade, Zrenjanin and Pančevo, are almost at the same distance. The administrative center is Zrenjanin, but the economic connection with Belgrade is much stronger, especially due to the large number of Czechs who are employed on the territory of Belgrade. According to the 2022 census, there were 2622 inhabitants.</h4>

    <img src="./Pictures/Centa on the map of the Josephine cadastre from 1769-72.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="Centa 1769-72">
    <p>The first mention of Čenta dates from 1549, in a Turkish notebook, about the description of Szeged's sandjak. At that time, 22 households (by first and last name) and Voja kaluđer were recorded. Almost all the time of the Turkish rule over today's Banat, Čenta was inhabited, although it is not mentioned in the Peć Katistig either in 1660 or 1666. At that time, only the settlement of Ječin, northeast of today's village, was recorded.</p>
    <p>Ječín was inhabited at the time of the expulsion of the Turks from Banat, in 1717, when there were 13 homes in the village and Pope Petar. Part of Ječina moved to Čenta, where Pope Petar was buried, and his monument is preserved, near the Old Church, to this day. On Marcy's map of Banat from 1723/25. Čenta (Črenta) was recorded as an abandoned village, but already in 1727, 22 households were recorded, so it is likely that it was inhabited in 1723 as well, but the population dispersed before the enumerators.</p>
    <p>Entering the military system, Chenta received the Germanized name Leopoldsdorf (1753-1888), which never caught on among the people. That foreign name "Leopoldova" (abbreviated) was named after the Austrian Emperor Leopold of Habsburg. In 1764, "Leopoldovo" was an Orthodox parish in the Protoprespriate of Bečkerek.

    <p>In 1797, when the Orthodox clergy of the Diocese of Timișoara were listed, there were four priests in Leopoldovo. They were priests from Paros, Pope Marko Nikolajević (handwritten 1762), Pope Jevtimije Drakulić (1789), Pope Avram Popović (1793) and Deacon Nikolaj Nikolajević.</p>
    <p>Chenta suffered a lot during the invasion of the Turks in 1736/37. year, so of the previous 22 homes, only 7 remained. The main cause of the decrease in the number of inhabitants was the plague. There is a preserved list of these households by name. According to the census from 1748, Chenta has 58 homes. In 1750/53. the village became part of the Banat Land Militia, and later belonged to the 12th German-Banat Regiment, until 1873, when the Military Border was abolished, and Čenta belonged to Toronto County. In 1774, the imperial auditor Erler stated that the border settlement of Leopoldova, predominantly inhabited by Serbs. The name of the village probably comes from the old Slavic word "Chantra" (bag), because in the Middle Ages the village was surrounded by ponds and swamps, so for most of the years it was practically on an island, and the inhabitants of that village were hidden like in a bag, from unwanted passers-by and tax collectors. After the abolition of the Banat military border, the village became part of the Perle administrative section, in the Toronto County.
